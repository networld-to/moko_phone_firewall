	* src_test/libphonefirewall.h:
	Deleting this header file. It was a copie of an old
	src/libphonefirewall.h which causes errors (wrong parameter type in
	the add functions).

	* src_test/testphonefirewall.c:
	Including not the src_test/libphonefirewall.h (see reasons above), but
	the header file src/libphonefirewall.h.

	* COPYING:
	Adding the GPLv2 licence

	* README:
	Adding a README file, to explain how compiling of the project works
	and other usefull informations.

	* src/phonefirewall_administration.c:
	Beginning with the implementation of the functions which adds telephone
	numbers (at the moment only for the blacklist) at the base of a binary tree.

	* ChangeLog:
	From now one we should write a detailed "ChangeLog" file to have a
	better overview over the changes.

	* doc/*:
	Updating the documentation.
	From now one I will always update the documentation before a
	commit/push.
	
	* src_test/:
	I don't have written the testing part of the code. (I promise the
	nexts commits will come with the full tests ;) )
