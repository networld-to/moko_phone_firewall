	* src/phonefirewall_administration.c:
	Beginning with the implementation of the functions which adds telephone
	numbers (at the moment only for the blacklist) at the base of a binary tree.

	* ChangeLog:
	From now one we should write a detailed "ChangeLog" file to have a
	better overview over the changes.

	* doc/*:
	Updating the documentation.
	From now one I will always update the documentation before a
	commit/push.
	
	* src_test/:
	I don't have written the testing part of the code. (I promise the
	nexts commits will come with the full tests ;) )
