	* TODO:
	Adding a few ideas for a alternative blocking/accepting system.

	* src/phonefirewall_administration.c:
	Making a function which sets the filename. Used 4 times in the
	program. So it's easier to change the filename format.

2008-05-13 Alex Oberhauser <oberhauseralex@networld.to>

	* src/phonefirewall_administration.c
	* src_test/testphonefirewall.c:
	Adding the add function for the whitelist, with appendant tests (at
	the moment there are only trivial tests).

	Changing the number type from "long long int" to "unsigned long long".

	* README:
	Adding our link and a description how you should start the program
	to the README file.

	Adding the information that CUnit is needed.

	* TODO:
	Adding a TODO file, so that a new developer knows what is planned and
	so he/she can begin to start to implement the things.

	* src/phonefirewall_administration.c:
	Implementing the check of the blacklist entries. It seams to work.
	When you start the program than from the directory where the Makefile
	is saved (bin_test/testphonefirewall), because the path is relativ to
	Makefile directory. There is the directory "db" where the entries will
	be saved.

	* src/libphonefirewall.h
	* src/phonefirewall_administration.c:
	Changing the implementation from binary tree to a simple saving to
	files. The files are named as follows:
		
		blacklist_$COUNTRYCODE-$AREACODE
		whitelist_$COUNTRYCODE-$AREACODE
	
	So it's possible to have a smaller number of numbers, because they are
	grouped by countrycode and than also by areacode. If a incoming call
	take place, we need only to parse the one specific file.


2008-05-10 Alex Oberhauser <oberhauseralex@networld.to>

	* src_test/libphonefirewall.h:
	Deleting this header file. It was a copie of an old
	src/libphonefirewall.h which causes errors (wrong parameter type in
	the add functions).

	* src_test/testphonefirewall.c:
	Including not the src_test/libphonefirewall.h (see reasons above), but
	the header file src/libphonefirewall.h.

	* COPYING:
	Adding the GPLv2 licence

	* README:
	Adding a README file, to explain how compiling of the project works
	and other usefull informations.

2008-05-10 Alex Oberhauser <oberhauseralex@networld.to>

	* src/phonefirewall_administration.c:
	Beginning with the implementation of the functions which adds telephone
	numbers (at the moment only for the blacklist) at the base of a binary tree.

	* ChangeLog:
	From now one we should write a detailed "ChangeLog" file to have a
	better overview over the changes.

	* doc/*:
	Updating the documentation.
	From now one I will always update the documentation before a
	commit/push.
	
	* src_test/:
	I don't have written the testing part of the code. (I promise the
	nexts commits will come with the full tests ;) )
