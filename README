PHONE FIREWALL README 
=====================

Informations
============

The Phone Firewall is a library which allows you to block telephone calls from
numbers which you don't like (also possible with SMS). You can also accept
only a few numbers and block the others. To realize this we use a blacklist
(all blocked numbers) and a whitelist (all accepted numbers).

Starting 
========

To compile the source code you need to have installed the toolchain for the OpenMoko
framework ([1] (i686) and [2] (x86_64)). If you have installed the toolchain into 
the standart path you can execute the script "env-export" with the command and
after that compile all: 

	$ . env-export
	$ make

If you want compile only special parts use:
	
	$ make doc                    # Compiles only the documentation.
	$ make test                   # Compiles only the test suite.
	$ make libphonefirewall.so    # Compiles only the library for the ARM
	                              # architecture.


Troubleshouting
===============

If the compiling fails or the test suite doesn't work check the Makefile if
all paths to the programs are correct. If they are and you have installed all
stuff you need to run and compile the software contact one of the maintainer.
