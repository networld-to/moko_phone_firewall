PHONE FIREWALL README 
=====================

Informations
============

The Phone Firewall is a library which allows you to block telephone calls from
numbers which you don't like (also possible with SMS). You can also accept
only a few numbers and block the others. To realize this we use a blacklist
(all blocked numbers) and a whitelist (all accepted numbers).

The sourcecode and all other files which are related to the project (and other
projects) you can find here [4]. If you want know more about our project see
[3], here you find all important informations.

Quickstart
==========

Download our modified toolchain from [5], then you can use the "./run.sh"
script. If something goes wrong you find under log/ the detailed output of the
compile process.


Starting 
========

To compile the source code you need to have installed the toolchain for the OpenMoko
framework ([1] (i686) and [2] (x86_64)), you need also the CUnit framework for
the testing (tested with CUnit 2.1). If you have installed the toolchain into the 
standart path you can execute the script "env-export" with the command and after 
that compile all: 
ATTETNTION: To compile the library for the OpenMoko you will need the
toolchain [5], with sqlite3 libraries included.

	$ . env-export
	$ make
	$ bin_test/testphonefirwall   # Start the program from the root
					direcotry (where the Makefile is), so
					that the program can save the
					blacklist/whitelist in the "db"
					directory.

If you want compile only special parts use:
	
	$ make doc                    # Compiles only the documentation.
	$ make test                   # Compiles only the test suite.
	$ make libphonefirewall.so    # Compiles only the library for the ARM
	                              # architecture.
	$ make pf_daemon	      # Compiles the daemon.


Troubleshouting
===============

If the compiling fails or the test suite doesn't work check the Makefile if
all paths to the programs are correct. If they are and you have installed all
stuff you need to run and compile the software contact one of the maintainer.
