The following points are to do (there are not complete):

	- [DONE] Implementing the remove functions for the black- and whitelist
        - [DONE] Creating a opkg package and distributing it over our server.
	- Making a .bb (bitbake) file, which install the library (if we would
	  use it also as a single part).
	- Using a git tag for the .bb-file, so during the install process the
	  files will be downloaded from our (other) server (when we have the
	  version v0.01 finished).
	- [FIXED] Changing the compiling process that all works well at the 
          OpenMoko
	- Adding the filtering by time and by location (GPS!?! GSM Cells!?!)
	- [NOFIX] [Extern Project] Designing and implementing a GUI which is
          suitable for a mobile device (for example the Neo 1973/FreeRunner).
	- [FIXED] [BUG] Fix the checking function.
	- [FIXED] [BUG] Segmentation fault at the end of the CUnit tests.
        - Implementing unicode support.
